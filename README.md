# GerGarage

The "Ger Garage "Mobile Application was designed based on the need to implement a system to organise and manage booking for a small garage, the "Ger Garage" Mobile Application was designed. This application solves a real problem for small businesses regarding booking allocation while helping to improve customer service, maximising repair time, and streamlining work. For this reason, "Ger Garagen" offers customers and employees a mobile application where they can log in and obtain information about their booking, as well as have access to all information regarding that service provided.

The application will offer the company access to all information in the form of a database and thus improve the way services will be provided in the future, or even expand the services provided according to the analysis of the data obtained. In addition, the application will help customers have access to specific data about the time and date of the appointment and save time.
